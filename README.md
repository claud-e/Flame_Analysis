# Flame_Analysis: Does a flame reaction indicate sexual intention?
## Methodology: 
An Instagram poll was conducted through which the next question was posed: Does :fire: indicate sexual interest in someone?. This poll was written in spanish and the translation is not exact, but it conveys the meaning of the original question as intended by the researchers.

The population that responded to the poll are all mexican citizens in a range of 19-35 years of age, all self-indentifying as male or female.

The results were aggregated in an Excel file, and to hide the identities of the participants an ID number was randomly assigned, this list is not available in this document.

The results were then exported as a csv file and imported to a jupyter notebook for their analysis using the _pandas_ library.

## Results:

Summary statistics:

A total of 53 votes were received, of which:

|   | Vote | Gender |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------|
| Top  | Yes  | Female |
| Frequency | 28  | 45 |


The gender distribution of voters is highly skewed towards women:

The voting distribution is fairly similar and not statistically significant (to be confirmed):

The drill-down of the vote distribution by gender is as follows:

## Conclusion:

This very limited poll has shown that the number of females that think a :fire: is indication of sexual intention is very similar to the ones that do not think so. While the males may be slightly skewed to thinking it is.

Unflortunately the sample size and the skewed gender of the data does not allow for any propper analysis and discussion of the experiment.

***FURTHER RESEARCH IS REQUIRED BEFORE ANY SOLID CONCLUSION CAN BE PRESENTED***
